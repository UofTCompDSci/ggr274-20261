    "\n",
    "Complete the tasks in this Jupyter notebook and submit your completed file to [MarkUs](https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/markus/main/login_remote_auth).\n",
    "Here are the instructions for submitting to MarkUs (same as last week):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download this file (`Lab_4.ipynb`) from JupyterHub. (See [our JupyterHub Guide](../../../guides/jupyterhub_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",
    "2. Submit this file to MarkUs under the **lab4** assignment. (See [our MarkUs Guide](../../../guides/markus_guide.ipynb) for detailed instructions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can use autotests with this week's lab to see if you are on the right track. Your TA and instructors can look in more detail to see if you answered all questions. The submission is a part of your Lab attendance grade."
